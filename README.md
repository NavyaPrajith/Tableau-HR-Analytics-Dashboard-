**About the Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project encompasses a range of HR-related metrics, including employee demographics, job satisfaction levels, department affiliations, and attrition status. Key attributes include age, gender, department, job satisfaction, education field, and attrition status, among others.

**Objective of the Project:**

The primary objective of this project is to create an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides HR professionals with actionable insights into employee attrition. By visualizing key performance indicators and detailed metrics, the dashboard aims to identify patterns and trends in attrition, helping HR departments to develop strategies for improving employee retention and satisfaction.

This HR Analytics dashboard leverages the power of Tableau to provide a comprehensive view of employee attrition and related metrics. It includes insights on attrition count, employee count, attrition rate, active employee count, and average age. Additionally, the dashboard presents visualizations of department-wise attrition, employee distribution by age group, job satisfaction levels, attrition by education field, gender-wise attrition rates across different age groups, and overall attrition by gender.
